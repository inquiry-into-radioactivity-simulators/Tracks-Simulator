## Use in Curriculum

For more information, see [Supplementary Materials for Radiation and Atomic Literacy for Nonscientists](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2013/10/23/342.6157.436.DC1/123003-Johnson-SM.pdf)

The Tracks simulator supports students in observing and making sense of the similarities and differences in alpha, beta, and gamma radiation and enables story-telling about the effects of radiation at different size scales. It also promotes understanding of the vast number of ionizations caused by a single alpha or beta and helps students realize that alphas interact much more strongly with matter than betas do.

I wrote this application when I was a little kid! So I'm sorry about the poor naming conventions and code quality.
